An Othello/Reversi Game

INTRODUCTION

Othello (aka Reversi) is a two player strategy game typically played
on an eight by eight board (like chess and checkers).  The rules
described in the next section are simple, but mastering the game can
be quite challenging.  For details, try Wikipedia.


HOW TO PLAY

At the outset, and after the computer makes a move, you must place a
black piece (*X*) at the end of a line of white pieces (O) which end
at another black piece.  If you cannot make such a move, the computer
will move again instead.

When you place a black piece as above, all the white pieces between it
and another black piece (in any direction) are flipped to black.  The
game continues until neither player can make a move.

At the end, the winner has the most pieces on the board.


DISCUSSION

This program implements a depth-first 'best worst-case' search
algorithm (see suggest_move() and weigh_move()).  The case evaluation
is based on heuristics, based somewhat on the discussion of Brand by
Anders Kierulf, except that the heuristics are fixed on cell weight,
not calculated by relating cells.

The heuristics were 'borrowed' from Gnothello (circa 1999), which now
appears to be called Iagno <https://live.gnome.org/Iagno>.

The weight of a move is calculated by adding not only the value of the
piece placed but of all those flipped.  See weigh_move() for more
detail.
